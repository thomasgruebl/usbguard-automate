Arguments:
  [1]  -tmp  Add the tmp flag to add USB devices temporarily (default is permanently)
```

**Description**


**Background**

In theory, an attacker with physical access to the unlocked machine could modify the /etc/usbguard/rules.conf file 
since the default permissions are set to -rw------- (read and write access for the user class).

Hence, after installing USBguard, the /etc/usbguard/rules.conf file permissions are automatically set to 000 and are only changed back 
while writing to the file in the *add_permanently* function in *automate_usbguard.sh*.
